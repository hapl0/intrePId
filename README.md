#Intrepid Frontend
------------------
Using :  
>Python2.7   
Flask  
Bootstrap  

------------------
Launch the application using _run.py_   
Prefer using the executable of python located in the virtualenv _flask/bin/python_   
Debug mode is enabled (no need to reload, flask will reload itself with each code change)    
    
If the virtualenv doesn't work for you (eg: you're running a 32-bit OS) simply execute that command :    
_flask/bin/pip-2.7 -r requirements.txt_
